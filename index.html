                                                        <p>By Lisa Quast , FORBES CONTRIBUTOR</p>

                                                        <p align="left">You attended the party of a long-time friend and ran into a lot of people from high school that you hadn’t seen in years. During chit-chat over appetizers and drinks, you could feel the friendly competition heating up.</p>
                                                        <p align="left">While comparing career accomplishments, you were shocked to learn that the kid from school with the genius IQ, the one all the teachers thought would be spectacularly successful, had struggled with his career. How could this be, you wondered. This was the person everyone thought would invent something that would change the world.</p>
                                                        <p align="left">It turns out that intelligence might not be the best indicator of future success. According to psychologist Angela Duckworth, the secret to outstanding achievement isn’t talent. Instead, it’s a special blend of persistence and passion that she calls “grit.”</p>
                                                        <div class="video-container"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PyS3_Qd62F8?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br>
                                                        <p align="left">Duckworth has spent years studying people, trying to understand what it is that makes high achievers so successful. And what she found surprised even her. It wasn’t SAT scores. It wasn’t IQ scores. It wasn’t even a degree from a top-ranking business school that turned out to be the best predictor of success. “It was this combination of passion and perseverance that made high achievers special,” Duckworth said. “In a word, they had grit.”
                                                        <p align="left">Being gritty, according to Duckworth, is the ability to persevere. It’s about being unusually resilient and hardworking, so much so that you’re willing to continue on in the face of difficulties, obstacles and even failures. It’s about being constantly driven to improve.</p>
                                                        <p align="left">In addition to perseverance, being gritty is also about being passionate about something. For the highly successful, Duckworth found that the journey was just as important as the end result. “Even if some of the things they had to do were boring, or frustrating, or even painful, they wouldn’t dream of giving up. Their passion was enduring.”</p>
                                                        <p align="left">What her research demonstrated is that it wasn’t natural talent that made the biggest difference in who was highly successful and who wasn’t – it was more about effort than IQ. Duckworth even came up with two equations she uses to explain this concept:</p>
                                                        <p align="center">Talent x effort = skill</p>
                                                        <p align="center">Skill x effort = achievement</p>
                                                        <p align="left">“Talent is how quickly your skills improve when you invest effort. Achievement is what happens when you take your acquired skills and use them,” Duckworth explained.</p>
                                                        <p align="left">As you can see from the equations, effort counts twice. That’s why IQ and SAT scores aren’t a good indicator of someone’s future success. It’s because those scores are missing the most important part of the equation – the person’s effort level or what Duckworth calls their “grittiness” factor (their level of persistence and passion).</p>
                                                        <p align="left">What does that mean for you? It means that it’s OK if you aren’t the smartest person in the room or the smartest person in the job. It means the effort you expend toward your goals (perseverance) and your dedication throughout your career journey (passion) are what matter more than how you scored on your SAT or an IQ test.</p>
                                                        <p align="left">Why? Because grit will always trump talent. Or as Duckworth notes, “Our potential is one thing. What we do with it is quite another.”</p>

                                                        <p align="left">Angela Duckworth operates the Duckworth Lab at the University of Pennsylvania, which studies the interplay between grit and self-control. According to the website:</p>
                                                        <p align="left">“Grit is the tendency to sustain interest in and effort toward very long-term goals. Self-control is the voluntary regulation of behavioral, emotional, and attentional impulses in the presence of momentarily gratifying temptations or diversions.”</p>
                                                        <p align="left">Duckworth studied under Martin Seligman, the father of positive psychology, at the University of Pennsylvania where she is an associate professor. She has focused on what it means to succeed. Passion and perseverance are the essence of success and no one knows this better than Duckworth. Her extensive research has found something profound.</p>
                                                        <div class="video-container"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/H14bBuluwB8?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br>
                                                        <p align="left">“Character is at least as important as IQ,” Duckworth says.</p>
                                                        <p align="left">Duckworth’s research recently won her a $625,000 MacArthur Fellowship in 2013. It is an extraordinary honor. It has been dubbed by the media as the “genius” award because of the prominence of those selected, but the award does more than recognize what the recipient has already done.</p>
                                                        <p align="left">While it is meant to appreciate and celebrate, it is largely given to inspire and promote creative development. It is specifically offered to help advance the potential the winner has for the creative expression of his or her work. In this regard Angela Duckworth’s potential is enormous. For more information check out the original extended Proof Positive blog at PsychCentral, or hear her speak about her work in this TED talk video.</p>
                                                        <p align="left">Duckworth and her colleague devised a measure of grit and self-control that could predict successful outcomes in different situations better than other measures such as standardized testing. Grit scores predicted final ranking in the Scripps National Spelling Bee, perseverance at West Point Military Academy and graduation from Chicago public schools. Additionally, she found measures of self-control are better predictors than IQ of both report card grades and improvement in these grades.</p>
                                                        <!-- <p align="center">Talent x effort = skill</p>
                                                        <p align="center">Skill x effort = achievement</p>
                                                        <p align="left">“Talent is how quickly your skills improve when you invest effort. Achievement is what happens when you take your acquired skills and use them,” Duckworth explained.</p>
                                                        <p align="left">As you can see from the equations, effort counts twice. That’s why IQ and SAT scores aren’t a good indicator of someone’s future success. It’s because those scores are missing the most important part of the equation – the person’s effort level or what Duckworth calls their “grittiness” factor (their level of persistence and passion).</p>
                                                        <p align="left">What does that mean for you? It means that it’s OK if you aren’t the smartest person in the room or the smartest person in the job. It means the effort you expend toward your goals (perseverance) and your dedication throughout your career journey (passion) are what matter more than how you scored on your SAT or an IQ test.</p>
                                                        <p align="left">Why? Because grit will always trump talent. Or as Duckworth notes, “Our potential is one thing. What we do with it is quite another.”</p> -->

                                            It is the ability to persist in something you feel passionate about even in the face of obstacles. This kind of passion is
                                            not about intense emotions or infatuation. It’s about having direction and commitment.
                                            When you have this kind of passion, you can stay committed to a task that may
                                            be difficult or boring.

                                            Research indicates that the ability to be gritty — to stick with things that are important to you and bounce back from failure
                                            — is an essential component of success, independent of and beyond what talent
                                            and intelligence contribute (Duckworth 2016).

                                            I’m going to say it again because it’s worth repeating, and goes against what we’re taught in school and in our social circles. Grit is important because it is a driver of achievement and success, independent of and beyond what talent and intelligence contribute. Being naturally smart and talented are great, but to truly do well and thrive, we need the ability to persevere. Without grit, talent may be nothing more than unmet potential. It is only with effort that talent becomes a skill that leads to success (Duckworth 2016).

                                            It is the ability to persist in something you feel passionate about even in the face of obstacles. This kind of passion is
                                            not about intense emotions or infatuation. It’s about having direction and commitment.
                                            When you have this kind of passion, you can stay committed to a task that may
                                            be difficult or boring.

                                            Research indicates that the ability to be gritty — to stick with things that are important to you and bounce back from failure
                                            — is an essential component of success, independent of and beyond what talent
                                            and intelligence contribute (Duckworth 2016).
