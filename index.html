                                                            surprised even her. It wasn’t SAT scores. It wasn’t IQ scores.
                                                            It wasn’t even a degree from a top-ranking business school that

                                                            combination of passion and perseverance that made high achievers
                                                            special,” Duckworth said. “In a word, they had grit.”

                                                                It’s about being unusually resilient and hardworking, so

                                            It is the ability to persist in something you feel passionate about even in the face of obstacles. This kind of passion is
                                            not about intense emotions or infatuation. It’s about having direction and commitment.
                                            When you have this kind of passion, you can stay committed to a task that may
                                            be difficult or boring.

                                                            During his time, his work was terribly unappreciated. It is said

                                                            His work was only appreciated after his death. Today his paintings

                                        It is the ability to persist in something you feel passionate about even in the face of obstacles. This kind of passion is
                                        not about intense emotions or infatuation. It’s about having direction and commitment.
                                        When you have this kind of passion, you can stay committed to a task that may be
                                        difficult or boring.

                                        Research indicates that the ability to be gritty — to stick with things that are important to you and bounce back from failure
                                        — is an essential component of success, independent of and beyond what talent and
                                        intelligence contribute (Duckworth 2016).
