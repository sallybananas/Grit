                                                            surprised even her. It wasn’t SAT scores. It wasn’t IQ scores.
                                                            It wasn’t even a degree from a top-ranking business school that
                                                            turned out to be the best predictor of success. “It was this
                                                            combination of passion and perseverance that made high achievers
                                                            special,” Duckworth said. “In a word, they had grit.”

It means that it’s OK if you aren’t the smartest person in the room or the smartest person in the job. It means the effort you expend toward your goals (perseverance) and your dedication throughout your career journey (passion) are what matter more than how you scored on your SAT or an IQ test.</p>

                                            It is the ability to persist in something you feel passionate about even in the face of obstacles. This kind of passion is
                                            not about intense emotions or infatuation. It’s about having direction and commitment.
                                            When you have this kind of passion, you can stay committed to a task that may
                                            be difficult or boring.

                                                            His work was only appreciated after his death. Today his paintings

                                                                        <br>

When faced with stress or adversity, no matter how big or small, kids in this group tend to falter. Can’t cope. Their grades suffer. Friendships languish. Maybe they have trouble sleeping or eating. Perhaps they get a lot of headaches or stomachaches.
                                                                        <br>

I’ve written about resilience here a number of times (see here and here for two recent examples), and it’s pretty clear that it’s a complex topic. Last week, I wrote about the way in which control fits into resilience, and referenced the famous “marshmellow experiment.”
                                                                        <br>

It turns out that IQ scores alone aren’t very good predictors of who will go on to college, who will actually finish their degrees.
                                                                        <br>
                                                                        <br>We know that character is one of the 7 C’s of resilience, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. But it’s always been notoriously difficult to measure. That is, until a professor named Angela Duckworth, then a doctoral student, sought some way to make sense of the qualities that go beyond IQ: “People who accomplished great things, she noticed, often combined a passion for a single mission with an unswerving dedication to achieve that mission, whatever the obstacles and however long it might take. ” (New York Times Magazine, Sept. 14, 2011).
                                                                        <br>
                                                                        <br>She named this quality “grit” and came up with a scale for measuring it. It’s deceptively simple, only takes a few minutes to fill out, and relies on the usually notoriously unreliable method of self-reporting. But when she tested it, she found that it was powerfully predictive of success. She tested it on college students and found that those who scored high on the Grit Scale had higher GPA’s, even if they initially had lower college board tests. She tested it on West Point cadets, and it turned out to be the most accurate predictor of who finished the grueling program.
                                                                        <br>
                                                                        <br>When they tested students in elementary and high schools, they found that while IQ scores predicted scores on government achievement tests, the Grit Scale was the better predictor of report card grades. Makes sense, since those latter grades include finishing homework projects, in-class participation and behaviour. And that has a lot more to do with self-control and character.
                                                                        <br>
                                                                        <br>How well would your child do on the Grit Scale? Before you take the test with them, consider that it might be most helpfully read as a rubric of skills you want to help your child develop. A low grit score does not spell the death knell for your child’s aspirations! This scale is used by schools to help build on those areas of weakness. You can improve their self-control, their self-discipline, etc. So take the final number with a grain of salt and see it as an opportunity.
